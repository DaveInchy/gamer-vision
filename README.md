# Gamer Vision Tools

Sick of those console players that don't even use github to get free aim-assist?
No? Might be because they get aim-assist (more like see thru walls -assist) by default, I might also conclude that consoles are not even getting jailbroken anymore since all the hacks are included these days.

Today might be your lucky day! We've been testing AI models to help us make non-detectable gamer vision cheats. This project is still in no pre-release state and is in active development. But this might be our only solution to finally wreck those stupid controllers and they owners.

We are planning to release an alpha once we have a programmable interface or plugin-system ready that can be utilised by anyone to use the data that we provide.
This means you might be able to even automate your game matches. if you know what that means... GREAT! You might now think, wait? is this legal or will I get banned?
To that we say: "no... the reason simply is, we dont inject anything, and still no predicable behaviour can be confirmed if they don't know by other factors that you're using AI models to help you play games". If you get caught it will probably be because you're already using suspicious behaviour or apps on your device.

PS: most text might be bullshat, maybe all of it, maybe its possibly or probably
